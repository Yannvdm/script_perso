# CSV Editor shell
CSV Editor Shell is an interactive Python command-line application designed for managing, viewing, sorting, and merging CSV datasets. It simplifies the process of handling tabular data files, allowing users to efficiently manipulate and analyze data through a set of intuitive commands.

# SMART Goal CSV Editor shell
## Specific:
CSV Editor shell enables users to merge multiple CSV files with compatible headers, sort datasets by specific columns, view data in a clean tabular format, and export datasets to new CSV files. It is ideal for those who need to work with large amounts of structured data efficiently.

## Measurable:
- The success of the program can be measured based on:
- The ability to successfully merge CSV files with matching headers.
- The sorting functionality based on user-selected columns (with an option for reverse sorting).
- The successful export of the current dataset to a new CSV file with a user-specified filename.
## Achievable:
The tool is designed to be simple to use, with built-in prompts for choosing files, sorting columns, and filenames for exports. Error messages guide the user if there are any issues with the data or input, ensuring a smooth experience.

## Realistic:
The application is practical and can handle typical CSV file operations (e.g., merging, sorting, and exporting) without requiring additional complex configuration. It is easy to execute tasks via the command line, making it accessible even for users with basic technical knowledge.

## Time-bound:
All tasks (adding files, sorting data, exporting results) can be completed in a matter of seconds to minutes depending on the dataset size, making it efficient for quick management of CSV files.
